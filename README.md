# tw-colortable-sh
_a script to generate a lolor lookup-table based on task color legend_

For some taskwarrior.org related scripts, I'd like to use colors from the current task theme. This (imaginary) script is designed to generate a table of ansi color-codes from the task color legend command.

STATUS: imaginary
TODO:
- determine optimal format for table (csv?)
