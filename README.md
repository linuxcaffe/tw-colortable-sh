# tw-colortable-sh
_a script to generate a color lookup-table based on *task color legend* command_

For some taskwarrior.org related scripts, I'd like to use colors from the current task theme. This (imaginary) script is designed to generate a table of ansi color-codes from the task color legend command.

STATUS: imaginary

TODO:
- determine optimal format for table (csv?)
- figure out how to parse the output of 'task color legend'
